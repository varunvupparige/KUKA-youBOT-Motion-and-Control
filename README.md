# KUKA-youBOT-Motion-and-Control
In this project, a control algorithm is constructed to plan a trajectory, simulate the control action of youBot (a mobile base with four meconium wheels and a 5R robot arm), to complete a task that youBot pick up a cube at an initial location, move and place the cube at the desired position using coppeliaSim simulation package.
